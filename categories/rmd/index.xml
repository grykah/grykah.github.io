      <description>Keyword and Summary GeneratorIn the process of creating a Knowledge Management System, a notable amount of time is spent reading and compiling keywords and summaries for the documents of interest. To optimize this process and reduce the time committment for creating a KMS, NLP techniques are useful.
Below, an article pdf or url may be entered to obtain the top 10 keywords from the article, top 10 important phrases from the article, a summary of the article, and the number of pages (for a pdf only).</description>

      <description>Movie Recommendation SystemI was recently inspired to create a movie recommendation system when a family member started hosting movie nights during the pandemic. There are some diverse tastes amongst the group of attenties so utilizing multiple genres and movies was a benefit for this project.
This post is a final product of a descent bit of initial data exploration, preprocessing, and similarity testing. Ultimately, the recommenderlab package was extremely helpful, although, I also explored tm and some of the statistical methods available through that package.</description>

      <description>The R language is fantastic for quickly turning data into plots, however, it is not commonly used for creating visual aids for presentation or publication figures. While it is more common to produce final figures with other software, the same quality figures can be created in R.
Herein I show several examples of plots, that I have re-created using R, in an aesthetically similar manner. In each example, I provide the original figure and then the R-code I used for replication, followed by the replicate figure.</description>

      <description>I recently began a project utilizing the incidence of COVID-19 in relation to other variables. In order to ensure my data is updated frequently enough, I wanted to have a method of monitoring COVID-19, real time, to see when any major changes occur. In order to achieve this, I built an interactive shiny app to monitor the data.
To build my shiny app, I am defining inputs as follows:* country: the name of the country* type: the type of case (i.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas Profiling</title>
      <link>/2020/08/04/eda/</link>

      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in any data science project. This step allows us to remove unuseful/incorrect data, understand the relationships within the data, and provides context required to develop models that will ultimately allow for accurate interpretation of results. EDA can be a time consuming process and if shortcuts are taken, it will hurt the analysis in the long run. However, pandas-profiling is an extremely powerful python package that can help with this process.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis Rmarkdown document shows the use of both R and Python for analyzing the London Boroughs dataset. The reticulate library allows us to use Python code in an R environment.
Load LibrariesData IngestionWe can use Python code to read in the data.
import pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as plturl_LondonHousePrices = &amp;quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/uk-house-price-index/70ac0766-8902-4eb5-aab5-01951aaed773/UK%20House%20price%20index.xls&amp;quot;properties = pd.read_excel(url_LondonHousePrices, sheet_name=&amp;#39;Average price&amp;#39;, index_col= None)properties.</description>
