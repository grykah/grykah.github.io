      <description>Movie Recommendation SystemI was recently inspired to create a movie recommendation system when a family member started hosting movie nights during the pandemic. There are some diverse tastes amongst the group of attenties so utilizing multiple genres and movies was a benefit for this project.
This post is a final product of a descent bit of initial data exploration, preprocessing, and similarity testing. Ultimately, the recommenderlab package was extremely helpful, although, I also explored tm and some of the statistical methods available through that package.</description>
